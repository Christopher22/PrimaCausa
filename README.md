# PrimaCausa
## Introduction
In Prima causa, you as god guide human civilizations through time, ensuring their survival, rewarding devotees with prosperity or punishing their decadence with your terrifying wrath. Your humans are good at building civilization and consuming the resources you provide. But they can’t save themselves from their own actions. Control their dominion over your world and protect it from their limitless desire for expansion. In this turn-based strategy game for ambitious deities and creative world builders, the player gets to control the civilizations not only by direct intervention but subtle manipulation of the terrain itself. Place a desert to limit the growth of cities. Place resources to aid in their development. Watch your children inherit your beautiful masterpiece.

## Gameplay
Drawing a leaf from contemporary strategy games like the ”Civilization” series (Sid Meier, 1991), this game is played turn based on a 3D game world of hexagonal grids. While there exists a litany of games like ”Populus” (Peter Molyneux, 1989) and ”Black and White” (Peter Molyneux, 2001) deﬁning their own class of god-games this project draws from, however the focus here is the criticism of the unsustainable and uncontrollable expansion and domination of the human race over the planet. Each tile represents a terrain type, containing maximum one resource or human settlement. Each turn the deity may use its divinity to manipulate the world: 
- Change the type of terrain 
- Place resources on compatible terrains 
- Place settlements for humans to expand on 
- Use its wrath to render tiles barren and settlements abandoned 
- Upgrade or downgrade the tier of settlements

It is just constrained by the amount of gained *divinity* - the universal in-game resource for the player. Divinity is gained by content devotees living in prosperous settlements. Each level of settlement has diﬀerent demands of resources which they gain from neighboring tiles. The more resources are available to them, the more pious they become in their devotion to the Prima Causa - the prime cause of their existence.
Once all the requirements of a settlement are fulﬁlled, based on speciﬁc probabilities, they might advance to the next tier of civilization - villages to towns, towns to cities and cities to sprawling metropolises. Furthermore, a settlement may expand to neighboring tiles given their stage of development. Expansion of settlements do not stop at resource tiles and instead consume them. Reckless expansion might, therefore, cause crucial resource depletion resulting in unfulﬁlled needs and discontent devotees.
After ending a turn, humanity reacts to the changes in their environment. Based on the accumulated expansion probabilities of the neighboring settlements, a settlement may expand to at most one free neighboring tile. On the other hand, a settlement may develop based on the likelihood of developments of itself and its neighbors. Both expansion and development take place if and only if all of the settlement’s needs are fulﬁlled. The game is lost when the accumulated divinity is depleted. The victory condition depends on each map, including but not limited to surviving a speciﬁc number of turns, accumulating a speciﬁc amount of divinity or nurturing a speciﬁed number of metropolises.
